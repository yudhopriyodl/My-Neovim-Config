# My Neovim Config ‚ú®

Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration! This setup leverages the powerful [**LazyVim**](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) plugin manager for efficient and streamlined plugin management. It also incorporates cutting-edge AI-powered tools like [**Gemini**](https://github.com/kiddos/gemini.nvim) and [**Avante**](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim) ü§ñ to significantly enhance your coding experience with intelligent code suggestions, seamless auto-completion, and boosted productivity üöÄ.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with this Neovim configuration, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    This command clones the entire configuration into your `~/.config/nvim` directory. If you already have an existing Neovim configuration, it's recommended to back it up first.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yudhopriyodl/My-Neovim-Config ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2.  **Launch Neovim:**
    After cloning, simply open Neovim. LazyVim will automatically detect the new configuration and begin installing all the necessary plugins. This process might take a few moments depending on your internet connection.
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
